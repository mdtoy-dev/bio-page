                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Greetings beautiful people, I'm Berk Toy -- Originally hailing from the vibrant city of Istanbul, my journey began in the halls of a medical faculty, fueled by a dream to become a healer. After completing my medical degree, life took an unexpected turn. Marriage led me across borders to the United Kingdom, where my stethoscope found a new rhythm in a part-time role within the healthcare sector, albeit not as a doctor. The shifts were a mosaic of experiences, but a persistent whisper echoedâ€”the call of coding and web development, a passion I had always harbored. In the present, I navigate the corridors of healthcare by day and the syntax of code by night.</p>
